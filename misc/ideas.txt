SPHERES, TIME AND DISTANCES

Moons: size 30°, tidal locked with Planet, Revolution in 6 days (Planet time)
Sun: size 3°.
Planet : tidal locked with Sun.
Day / Sun cycle: by solar eclispes. Hours and Degrees are the same. 1 Day is 60 hours, 1 Hour is 60 Minutes / 1°, 1 Minute is 60 Seconds.
  1 Hour is equivalent to the Moons moving 1° in the sky.
  24 Hours are Night (eclispe).
  3 Hours are Dawn and Dusk.
  30 Hours are Day.
  The hottest hour is just before Dusk, the coldest just before Dawn.

6 Days per Week => 1 Week is 360°, Moons Revolution.
5 Weeks per Month => 30°, 
12 Months per Year => 360°, Planet Revolution.

1 Meter is the distance of 1'' / 30 of the Planet circonference => PlanetR = 19 440 000/π
PlanetR = 6 187 944,1874129 m
The Planet and The 6 Moons have the same mass (equivalent to volume)
4/3 * π * PlanetR^3 = 6 * 4/3 * π * MoonR^3 
PlanetR^3 = 6 * MoonR^3
MoonR = PlanetR / 6^(1/3)
MoonR = 0.55 PlanetR
MoonR = 11 244 240,810244 m

For comparison: 
EarthMoonR = 1 737 000 m
EarthR = 6 371 000 m 

WARNING: The Terran Metter and the Planet Metter are NOT the same. The Planet Metter should be more or less beetween 0.8 and 1.2 Earth Metter, but we don't know more than that.
(Earth and the Planet have more or less the same composition, so we can directly link gravity to volume (4/3*πR^3).
The Planet must have a gravity pull beetween 0.5G and 1.5G).

SunR and Sun - Planet distance: Irrelevant, but it appears as 3° from the Planet surface.

Planet - Moons distance: The Moons appear as 30° from the Planet surface, and moonR = 19 440 000/(π*6^(1/3)), so D = 30*π/180 * moonR 
D = 60 * 19 440 000 / (6^(1/3))
D = 641 894 657,18512 m

Concerning nights : the Moons are smaller than the Planet, so only the regions around the Equator have a night.

We can get the size of the Moon's shadow =>

sin(ShadowAngle) = MoonR / PlanetR
ShadowAngle = arcsin(MoonR / PlanetR)

ShadowAngle = arcsin( 6^(1/3) )
ShadowAngle = 33.3890519802511°
ShadowAngle = 33° 23' 21''

APPLIED TO THE GAME

In the Game, we will scale down the Planet by x30, so 1 Meter will be the distance of 1'' of the Planet circonference.
